Hello!

This app is developed in core php without frameworks. I structured my framework based on MVC(like mini Codeigniter).

To launch app you must import database which is in database folder. Make sure you change .htaccess file if you are renaming folder.
Go here :
public/.htaccess
AND
RewriteBase /test/public <-------
And make sure you also change name of the database if you are importing yours or if you have password for localhost. <--------HERE----------> app/config/config.php
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is for creating schedules. Users have to sing up first, log in and then you will able to make schedules clicking on number of date. You can view all your schedules on Schedules tab. You can't insert more than one schedule per day.
I also made Motivation page where you can be inspired and get your motivation(this page can see all users, you don't have to be registered. It is a free dose of motivation).

Put project files in your xamp,wamp or lamp folder(I am using WAMP so my folder goes to wamp/www). Then start via browser with this url localhost/test. Register, log in and start schedule your days.

For the design and front end part i used bootstarp and css.
